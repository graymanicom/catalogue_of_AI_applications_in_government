The Danish Government (Regeringen), KL (Kommunernes Landsforening) and Danish Regions (Danske Regioner) has agreed that Danish municipalities should test artificial intelligence solutions to better understand how these can be utilized to improve the quality and capacity in the public sector in the future. The goal of AIR is to develop a decision-support tool, that can provide case workers with an objective measurement of a citizen’s current eligibility for a certain rehabilitation course, their risk of failing during such a course and an estimate of how well the citizen is thought to do in the course. Current courses span 12 weeks and consist of physical exercises done several times a week by the citizen and evaluated at regular intermediate steps by the care assistant. Performance is measured in terms of improved self-sufficiency and reduced reliance on home help.

When the users find useful metadata descriptions, they do not have to re-invent that information, but can reuse existing descriptions, and so save time and money. When the developers use the same datamodels and code sets, unnecessary variation can be avoided. For example, the idea of OOTS is to use data that is collected by a certain authority, so that there is no need to copy the data for other authorities. Those can request the information they need from the authority that owns the data. But one needs to know the contents of the data in order to request it in semantically correct manner.

PSTW-2615,Document Review in Service Requests powered by Gen AI,https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/public-sector-tech-watch/2025-best-cases-award,"INPS provides services where users are required to submit various types of documents to support their requests, which must undergo a thorough review to verify their validity. This process involves the manual review of millions of documents annually by operators, all within a constrained timeframe. This involves a wide variety of documents (invoices, contracts, travel tickets, payment receipts, etc), making the process highly time-consuming and error prone. The goal of the project was to streamline and enhance the verification process through AI-powered automation, reducing manual workload, ensuring consistency in checks, and improving response times for citizens. To address these challenges, an innovative solution has been developed, integrating on-premise Generative Artificial Intelligence technologies designed to support operators in document analysis activities. Key features of the solution include:
•	Automatic classification of documents based on both type and content;
•	Data extraction and verification, with automated comparison between the information in the documents, the tender requirements, and the associated metadata;
•	Smart visualization of AI-extracted fields, with automatic highlighting directly within the document for easy reference;
•	Decision support, offering a detailed summary of the extracted data, flagging any discrepancies, and assisting with manual validation.
This solution significantly streamlines the verification process, reducing manual effort and increasing both the speed and consistency of checks, delivering concrete benefits to both staff and citizens. Moreover, the system’s ability to adapt and learn from new data ensures continuous performance improvement, supporting progressively more effective procedure management. The solution aims to deliver benefits for both operators and citizens. Overall, the implementation of Generative AI has proven to be a transformative step in modernizing the document verification process, setting a strong foundation for future innovation and scalability. The next objective is primarily to adopt this solution for the other services within the INPS system.",National,Italy,IT,Italian National Institute of Social Security (INPS),Central-Government,Social protection,Social protection n.e.c.,Implemented,2025,,Internal management,Internal support processes,No,No,Artificial Intelligence,,G2G,,,,,,,x,x,,x,x,,,,,,,,Self-reporting tool,Learning,Machine learning,Generative AI,,,,,,,,,,,,,10/09/2025,
PSTW-2616,Text Simplification for Citizens with GenAI,https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/text-simplification-for-citizens-with-genai/,"Clear and accessible communication is essential to ensure that citizens can effectively navigate public services. INPS—Italy’s National Institute of Social Security and the largest welfare institution in Europe—serves approximately 45 million citizens through nearly 500 digital services related to pensions and welfare. The clarity of these service descriptions plays a critical role in guaranteeing equitable access and a positive user experience. To address the challenges of bureaucratic language, INPS has launched a structured simplification program aimed at making content understandable to users with a middle school level of education. Over 700 texts have been manually simplified so far, resulting in an increase in the average Gulpease readability score from 57 to 64—a substantial improvement in accessibility. However, this manual process is labor-intensive, requiring specialised linguistic and legal expertise, and is not easily scalable.
The need for plain language in public administration has long been acknowledged in Italy. A 2002 directive still in force emphasizes that “all texts produced by administrations must be designed and written to be understood by those who receive them.” Yet institutional communication remains overly formal and complex, hindering citizens’ ability to fully access and understand critical services. While simplification improves transparency and public trust, it must also preserve the legal precision required for official documentation. To overcome these limitations, INPS has integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) into its simplification workflow, developing a semi-automated system—operating in a human-in-the-loop model—that is both scalable and efficient. This solution can process high volumes of content while ensuring readability, semantic accuracy, and legal compliance. A dedicated evaluation framework was introduced to measure key aspects of the output, including readability, fluency, and content preservation. User testing further validated the approach, confirming the quality of AI-generated content in comparison to both the original and manually simplified texts. The AI-based system delivers expert-level results in a fraction of the time and cost required by manual processes. It enhances INPS’s operational efficiency, standardizes quality across service pages, and ensures that content remains accessible and legally sound. Human oversight guarantees accuracy and relevance, while integrated metrics provide transparency and guide ongoing optimization. A large-scale user study involving A/B testing with 1,620 participants confirmed the model’s effectiveness. AI-generated texts were preferred in over 70% of cases when compared to the original versions and outperformed them across all measured dimensions: fluency (+14.1%), readability (+13.5%), clarity (+11.1%), and engagement (+12.3%). The AI semplified versions outperformed also the corresponding human simplified texts across all the qualitative metrics.  Citizens are the ultimate beneficiaries of this transformation. By simplifying complex institutional language, INPS reduces barriers to access for individuals with limited language skills, lower educational attainment, or reading difficulties. More inclusive communication strengthens transparency, encourages greater civic engagement, and builds trust between citizens and institutions. Beyond INPS, this AI-driven approach has strong potential for adoption in other sectors where complex language limits accessibility—such as healthcare, legal services, taxation, and social welfare. Its ability to adapt to diverse regulatory and linguistic contexts makes it a powerful tool for modernising public communication across government systems.
In summary, the integration of LLMs into INPS’s content simplification strategy demonstrates how generative AI can enhance accessibility, efficiency, and trust in public services—delivering clear, comprehensible, and citizen-centered communication at scale.",National,Italy,IT,Italian National Institute of Social Security (INPS),Central-Government,Social protection,Social protection n.e.c.,Implemented,2025,,Internal management,Internal support processes,No,No,Artificial Intelligence,,G2C,x,x,x,x,x,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,Self-reporting tool,Learning,Machine learning,Generative AI,,,,,,,,,,,,,10/09/2025,
